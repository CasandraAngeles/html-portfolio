<hr />

<h3>1. Malibu's Most Wanted:</h3>
<h5>Released April 18, 2003</h5> 

<p>I saw this movie in the theaters when I was 8 years old and LOVED it! A Jamie Kennedey classic no doubt, not to 
mention the supporting roles of Tay Diggs and Anthony Anderson's characters. The silly plot and talented cast make for 
a hilarious and fun journey that everyone is sure to enjoy! </p>

<h3>2. Elf: </h3> 
<h5>Released November 7, 2003</h5>

<p>A classic in my family for sure, it was Grammy's favorite movie. Will Ferrell stars in this instant Christmas classic. A
feel good movie full of spirit, love, and a journey of self discovery. This one is sure to be a good time for the whole family!

<h3>3. Kicking and Screaming:</h3> 
<h5>Released May 13, 2005</h5>

<p>Although 3rd on the list, does not make it 3rd in my heart. This is one of my all time favorites and of course another
Will Ferrell masterpiece, but let's be honest does Will Ferrell do anything bad? Not that it even needs to be said, but the 
only correct answer to that question is no. This fun comedy about a father and a son turned rival little league soccer coaches is 
so fun to watch. Despite the frills and mishaps along, even though let's face it, that's the parts that make this film so 
hilarious, we get to see into the dynamics of a bond between fathers and sons. </p>
